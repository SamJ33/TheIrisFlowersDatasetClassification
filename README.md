# Iris Flower Classification Project

##  Description

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to classify iris flowers into one of three species based on their physical features. It is an introductory machine learning exercise that covers key concepts such as model training, evaluation, regularization, and visualization.
I explored the dataset, applied a classification model, evaluated its performance, and visualized the results to gain deeper insights into both the data and the learning process.


## Classes in the Dataset

The model predicts one of the following iris flower species:

- `0` → **Setosa**
- `1` → **Versicolor**
- `2` → **Virginica**


## Features Used

Each iris sample includes the following features:

- `sepal length (cm)`
- `sepal width (cm)`
- `petal length (cm)`
- `petal width (cm)`

## Techniques Applied
- **Data loading**
- **Data Exploratory Analysis**
- **Train/Test Split**
- **Cross-Validation** (for more reliable evaluation)
- **Regularization (L2)** using the `C` hyperparameter:
  - Smaller `C` → Simpler model (more regularization)
  - Larger `C` → Complex model (less regularization)
- **Confusion Matrix & Accuracy Score**
- **Data Visualization** using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
